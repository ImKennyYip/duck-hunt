In this tutorial, you will learn how to code a shooting game, duck hunt, using javascript and HTML5 canvas.

Throughout the tutorial, you will learn how to create img tags on the web page,  create the game loop, add click handlers to shoot the ducks, add a running score, and reset the game every time the duck(s) are cleared from the map. In duck hunt, there are 1 or 2 ducks flying around and the goal is to shoot the ducks to gain points. The player can shoot the ducks by simply clicking on them.

## Homework:
You can continue working on this project if you like. You can design your own map and replace the birds with any enemy target. You can also have the enemies teleport randomly around the screen and give them healthpoints so that it would take more than one shot to defeat them. In addtion, you can add a timer, just like in the original duck hunt game, where the player has a certain number of seconds before the user gets game over. Another way to get game over is if the player misses the shot a certain number of times in total.
